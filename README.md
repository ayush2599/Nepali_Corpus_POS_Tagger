# Nepali_Corpus_POS_Tagger
This project provides a start to making NLP publically available to general users and also for researchers. This project allows a user to use the Nepali Corpus to know the occurrences of various Nepali words from a huge dataset, and also know in which category of data that word has been used the most or the least. Also the project allows user to tag a word or a sentence with its POS from a limited dataset that has been created.
